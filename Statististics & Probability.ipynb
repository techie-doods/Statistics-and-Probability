The Ratio data has an added feature which makes the ratios of the objects meaningful as well, and that is that they have a true zero point. Zero represents the absence of a certain property. So when we say something is of zero weight, we mean that thing has an absence of mass. Ex:Weight and Height of person</p>\n",
